An Agent-Based Model of the Scapegoat Mechanism
This repository contains an agent‑based model (ABM) implemented in NetLogo that simulates the scapegoat mechanism described by René Girard within a small‑world network. The model allows researchers to explore how network connectivity, agent roles and tension thresholds influence the emergence of leaders and the selection of a collective target.

Features
Small‑world topology: the network is generated via a Watts–Strogatz rewiring process, capturing the mix of local clustering and long‑range ties seen in many real systems.

Agent roles: agents may be neutral, friendly (higher propensity to form links), skeptic (blocks accusation transmission), leader or scapegoat.

Mimetic tension transfer: agents pass tension through accusations, following Girard’s principle that differentiation occurs through a common enemy.

Leader emergence and scapegoat selection: once collective tension exceeds a threshold, highly connected stable agents can become leaders who coordinate accusations against a target.

How to run the model
Download and install NetLogo.

Clone or download this repository. If using Git, run:

sh
Copiar
Editar
git clone https://github.com/carlospaes120/scapegoat.git
Open the .nlogo file in NetLogo and press setup followed by go. The model interface exposes sliders and switches for all key parameters (network size, rewiring probability, tension threshold, etc.). A brief description of each parameter can be found in the NetLogo info tab.
